MAV Message and Control Sequences

It all flows from the SatNavFix message issued by the UAS via mavros.

Given the launch of gf_uas_demo.launch:

I. At Startup (in parallel):
  1.  The gf_server is started.
      a.  It reads from the Portal the list of relevant entitlements.
            class_entitlements_properties_json()
      b.  Subscibes to SatNavFix message.

  2. The gf_sensor_relay is also started and instantiates the Mav Sentinel.
      a.  The Mav Sentinel initializes its state:
            isOnTheGround = true, isArmed = false, etc
      b.  The Mav Sentinel subscribes to UAS mavros topics:
            state, extended_state, home_position/home, global_position/global
      c.  The Mav Sentinel subscibes to gf_server entitlements topics
            rtl_gei, altitude_gei

  (*) There are no restrictions on the UAS to fly without knowledge of the
      geofences. That was a design decision that can be readily changed.

II. Run-Time:
  1.  The gf_server receives the /fix satellite message from the UAS.
  2.  It retrieves the feature collection from the  Portal.
      ambient_fences_geojson_roi()
  3.  If the feature collection is received, it publishes various forms of
      the message along with entitlement dwell messages.
  4.  The Mav Sentinel receives UAS state and position information from the
      UAS.
  5.  The Mav Sentinel recieves entitlement information from the gf_server.
  6.  Base on the information in 4) and 5), the sentinel determines whether
      the UAS is still safe to fly.
      a.  If unsafe, then the sentinel invokes an action:
          One of: RTL, LandNow, GotoWaypoint.

  (*) The tool rqt_graph shows the message dependencies but not the sequence.
  (!) The tool rqt can be used to watch message flows.
